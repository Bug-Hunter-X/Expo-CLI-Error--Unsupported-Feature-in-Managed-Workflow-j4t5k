This repository demonstrates a common error in Expo CLI: attempting to use a native module or feature unsupported by Expo's managed workflow. The `expoBug.js` file contains code that triggers the error. The solution in `expoBugSolution.js` shows how to either use an Expo-compatible alternative, eject from the managed workflow to a bare workflow, or find a different solution.
